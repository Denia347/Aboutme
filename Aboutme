I am  jamaican native student that leaves in the state of new york with my mother, sister, nephew, and neice. 
My sister ad i moved to the US in May 2013 with just a few change of clothes in our suitcases.
The mother intended to offer us a better life by providing an education that wasnt accessible in Jamaica.
